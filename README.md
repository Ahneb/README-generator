## Description
This is a CLI based `README.md` generator. By prompting the user with multiple questions regarding information for the readme, it produces a template that can be copy and pasted into a readme file. This application makes use of inquirer with inputs and lists to gather needed information and then uses the fs package to read and write the information into a `result.md` file as raw markdown text. License information is generated based off of the github api information. A badge with a link to githubs licenses page is made and placed at the top of the readme.
